                    <h2>2 more Philippine eagles released into Leyte forests</h2></a>
                    BURAUEN, Leyte — The Philippine Eagle Foundation (PEF) on Thursday released two more Philippine eagles into the Anonang-Lobi mountain range in a continued effort to repopulate the critically endangered species in the province.<br>Kalatungan I, a 3-year-old male eagle, was the first to soar out of a 10-by-10-foot hack cage at 9:32 a.m. Friday. The second eagle, an 11-year-old female named Lyra Sinabadan, followed at 10:37 a.m., more than an hour later.<br>Both birds were rescued in Bukidnon and arrived in Burauen on March 21. They are part of a broader initiative to reintroduce the national bird into Leyte’s forests.<br>Conservationists made history first on June 28, 2024, by releasing a pair of Philippine eagles into the area. Kalatungan I and Lyra Sinabadan are the second mated pair to be released under the program.<br>The eagles underwent a medical checkup Tuesday night near their hack cage. They were declared fit for release by veterinarian Sheen Erica Gadong.<br>Kalatungan I, Lyra Sinabadan, and another male eagle named Lakpue made an 18-hour land trip from Davao City to Leyte on March 21 as part of the ongoing Philippine eagle reintroduction effort.

                            <h2>Philippine dollar reserves fall to $104.6B in April</h2></a>
                            MANILA, Philippines — The country’s gross international reserves (GIR) continued to decline in April, with outflows stemming from foreign debt payments of the government and foreign exchange interventions of the central bank.<br>The GIR settled at $104.6 billion as of end-April, from the end-March level of $106.7 billion, the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas (BSP) reported.<br>Despite the decline, the BSP said the latest GIR level provided a “robust” external liquidity buffer, equivalent to 7.2 months’ worth of imports of goods and payments of services and primary income.<br>Moreover, the latest dollar reserves are enough to cover about 3.6 times the country’s short-term external debt based on residual maturity.<br>Dissecting the GIR components, foreign investments declined by 3.1 percent amid tariff-induced market volatility.<br>But the value of the BSP’s gold holdings went up by 4.5 percent to a new record high of $13.3 billion, while foreign exchange holdings grew by 23.5 percent.<br>“The country’s strong external position could help stabilize the peso exchange rate,” said Michael Ricafort, chief economist at Rizal Commercial Banking Corp.

Sherwin Gatchalian asked DepEd whether the new SHS curriculum will enable students to become college-ready and if the agency could guarantee that what the students took up in SHS will no longer be taken up in college.<br>At the end of Gatchalian’s questions, DepEd Undersecretary for Curriculum and Teaching Gina Gonong confessed that she wants to be as realistic as possible.<br>“The five proposed core subjects are not enough for students to be college-ready,” Gonong simply said, quickly explaining that in order to equip learners, they need to take electives.<br>“So for example, [if] a student wants to do a STEM course later on in college, we need to guide our student to take science-related electives,” she said.<br>To better guide students in the choice of electives, Gonong said they have asked the Commission on Higher Education (Ched) to give them a list of basic requirements of subjects to pursue courses like engineering, chemistry, and teaching.

Kilala n’yo ba kung sino ang nagpasimuno ng selebrasyon na ito?<br>Sa Pilipinas, pinaniniwalaang nag-start ang pagdiriwang ng Araw ng Mga Ina noong 1921 nang simulan ng grupong Ilocos Women’s Club ang kauna-unahan nilang proyekto.<br>Pagsapit ng 1936, sa bisa ng deklarasyon ni President Manuel L. Quezon, ginawa nang taon-taon ang Mother’s Day celebration sa buong bansa tuwing first Monday ng Disyembre.<br>Nagpatuloy ito hanggang sa isang proklamasyon na pinirmahan ni dating Pangulong Ferdinand Marcos, Sr. noong 1980.<br>Ngunit nang umupo si dating Pangulong Cory Aquino sa Malacañang, inilipat ang Araw ng Mga Ina tuwing ikalawang Linggo ng Mayo, na isinunod sa pagdiriwang ng Amerika at iba pang bansa.

Congress is on a break because of the mid-term polls and is due to return on June 2.<br>As of now, the complaint, as shown in the group page, also does not bear a received stamp from Velasco’s office.

If there is no consensus again, two more votes will be held in the afternoon.<br>The cardinals will remain behind closed doors until the newly elected 267th pontiff has a clear blessing to lead the world’s 1.4 billion Catholics. They are sworn to secrecy about the centuries-old process under threat of excommunication.
